* Stock Ticker App

** ToDo List [0/0]


** Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: http://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/ [0/4]
- [ ] User Story: I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
- [ ] User Story: I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
- [ ] User Story: I can remove stocks.
- [ ] User Story: I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
